# MoreSlimes
MoreSlimes is a Minecraft Spigot plugin for increasing the spawn rate of Slimes!

## Progress
This plugin is VERY incomplete right now, and I highly recommend against using this on any production server.
That means don't run this on any Minecraft server where
In fact, to highlight how incomplete this plugin is, it currently has:
- Slimes spawning pretty much anywhere under Y=40. This includes water blocks, air blocks and probably
lava blocks.
- A partially implemented configuration file support. I.e. doesn't work properly yet
- Increased server lag. No hard numbers, but the lag's definitely there. I need to fix that.

## Contributions and development
Feel free to report bugs through GitHub Issues. You're also welcome to make pull requests.
If you wish to contribute to this plugin's development, or make a fork, clone this project and use
Maven to resolve the plugin's dependencies. Seriously, use Maven. It's a godsend for anything that
depends on an external library.
